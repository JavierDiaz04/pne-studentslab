When you execute the program and debug it, there is an error given at the line " t3 = 2 * (t0 / t1) ", when you debug it
it gives that there is a ZeroDivisionError given. When a = 0, and as in the function f we return the value "a - b", we
obtain that "t1 = 0" and as "t3" depends on the value obtained when you divide a value "t0" by "t1" and as "t1 = 0" then
there is an error. Every time "a == b" then "t1 = 0" and we will get this error. That is why results 1, 3 and 4 are
computed.
